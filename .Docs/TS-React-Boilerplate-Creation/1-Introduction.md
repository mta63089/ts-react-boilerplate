## ðŸ”° Introduction

Welcome to the ts-react-boilerplate - a TypeScript React Boilerplate project. The main objective of this project is to provide a quick and easy way to start a TypeScript React project. This boilerplate provides a basic file structure, and it comes pre-configured with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and React.

In this guide, we will walk you through how to set up a new project with this boilerplate. We will cover everything from creating a new repository on GitHub, cloning the repository to your local machine, initializing the project with NPM, and installing all the required dependencies.
