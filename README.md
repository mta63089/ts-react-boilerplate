## Intent

For now the intent of this repo is to showcase an uncommon full stack setup using some of the best libraries, packages, framework, and tooling out there. In the future I hope to incrementally add features like component and page generation as well as a workflow generator. Currently, this is still a work in progress and I cant guarantee its functionality for your situation but encourage you to make a similar boilerplate for yourself to get a better understanding of how some of the new tech feels to develop as well as have something in place for yourself to create some cool new apps!
